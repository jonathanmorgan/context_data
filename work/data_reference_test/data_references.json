Leptin antigens and mRNA were studied in the anterior pituitary (AP) cells of male and female rats to learn more about its regulation. This study was motivated by several factors. First, it is unclear if the pituitary leptin represents a significant source of the circulating hormone, because the cells are normally bathed in serum leptin from fat cells. However, it could be significant locally if it is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine mechanisms. Therefore, we were curious about potential regulators and changes in expression of AP leptin. Second, the lack of agreement about leptin production sites in the rodent AP could reflect species or tissue preparation differences. Third, leptin proteins could be in a cellular site as a result of binding to leptin receptors. To test these possibilities, we developed both immunolabeling and in situ hybridization (ISH) protocols that would detect co-expression of leptin in cells with somatotropic phenotypes. Once we identified leptin in somatotropes, we began tests of differential and regulated expression of pituitary leptin.\n"

Separate experimental conditions were created, so that the \u201cbiochemical cause\u201d was argued as both an aggravating and mitigating factor.
